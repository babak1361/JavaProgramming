    you are writing a code for the log-in

        username: Cydeo
        password: Cydeo123

        Ask the user to enter their credentials.
        If credentials are matched, your program should
         print "Logged in."
        If the credentials are not matched, the program
        should allow the user to have three attempts to enter correct credentials and if all three attempts are failed, then print "Your account is lucked."
