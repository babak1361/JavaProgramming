/* Write a program that can remove the duplicated
characters from a String
            Ex:
                input:
                    AABBCCBC

                Output:
                    ABC

            Hint: You can add each characters of the string into
             another String
                  Condition: the character is not contained in the
                  other String yet before you are adding
